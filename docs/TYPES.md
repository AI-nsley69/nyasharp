Nyasharp is a dynamically typed language, a variable can currently inherit the following data types with the corresponding C# type:
```
Number - double
String - string
Boolean - bool (either twue or fawse)
```

It is possible to add a string to a number, the number will be converted into a string. You can also concat a string with the add op:
```
>.< a o/ "Hello :";
>.< b o/ 3;
pwint a +.+ b;
```
This will print `Hello :3`.
